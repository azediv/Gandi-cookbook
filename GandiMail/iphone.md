====== Setting up your iPhone for Gandi Mail ======

Setting up your iPhone for Gandi mail just takes a minute. Here's what to do:

#.  go to "**Settings**", then
#  "**Mail, Contacts, Calendars**", then
  #.  Click "**Add Account...**"
4. Choose "**Other**"
5. select "**Add Mail Account**" under "**Mail**"

Here, you will just enter the information as requested. I am providing some example values below, you will need to replace them with your own:

  Name: Jon Doe
  Address: jon@example.com
  Password: yourpasswd
  Description: will be filled in automatically, but can be anything

6. click "**Next**"

7. Choose IMAP or POP

===== Instructions for POP and IMAP =====
==== Incoming Mail Server ====
  Host Name: mail.gandi.net
  User Name: joe@example.com
  Password: yourpasswd
 
==== Outgoing Mail Server ====
  Host Name: mail.gandi.net
  Username: joe@example.com
  Password yourpasswd

8. click "**Save**". 


It will not check the configuration and will display the message "Verifying" at the top. This process can take about 30 seconds. When complete, it will bring you back to the screen that shows your email Accounts.


====== Troubleshooting ======

Not all providers will let you send emails from a third-party SMTP server. If you encounter problems sending mail (//ex. a message saying that  the SMTP server mail.gandi.net is not responding//), just use the smtp server of your local internet provider. 

You can verify the standard settings (port, etc.) at http://wiki.gandi.net/en/mail/standard-settings
