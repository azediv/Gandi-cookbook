auto deploy from GitHub to Simple Hosting
=========================================

This tutorial will be useful if you:

* have a website with static content
* want to host the source code for your website on GitHub or BitBucket
* want the site to be hosted on a Gandi Simple Hosting instance, and 
* you want your site to be updated automatically any time changed are pushed to the repo.

## Requirements

* A Gandi Simple Hosting (PHP/MySQL) (or create one below)
* A GitHub or BitBucket account
* A public git repo with static web content

We're using the [Gandi CLI](http://cli.gandi.net) for this tutorial, but you can also perform these steps within your Gandi account.

## Warning

Simple Hosting is not designed for use of git from within the instance. It only partially works and even the things we're doing below are very fragile. Do not make any changes to files directly on your instance, or you will get stuck and have to start over.

### Create a PHP/MySQL Simple Hosting Instance

    $ gandi paas create --name squirrels --type phpmysql --vhosts squirrels.gandi.xyz

### Connect to the instance via SSH

The following command will activate the console and automatically open a connection to it.

    $ gandi paas console squirrels

### Clone the repo to the instance

Clone the repo into the `htdocs/` directory:

    $ cd /srv/data/web/vhosts/squirrels.gandi.xyz/htdocs
    $ rm index.html                                               # Because the directory has to be empty first
    $ git clone https://github.com/soulshake/squirrels.git .      # Note the dot at the end
    $ ls -la

In my case, the output of `ls -la` looks like this:

    hosting-user@squirrels:~/web/vhosts/squirrels.gandi.xyz/htdocs$ ls -la
    total 9
    drwxrwxr-x 4 hosting-user hosting-user   7 Dec 14 22:52 .
    drwxrwxr-x 3 root         hosting-user   3 Dec 14 07:36 ..
    drwxr-xr-x 8 hosting-user hosting-user  15 Dec 14 22:52 .git
    -rw-r--r-- 1 hosting-user hosting-user  79 Dec 14 22:48 README.md
    drwxr-xr-x 2 hosting-user hosting-user   3 Dec 14 22:48 images
    -rw-r--r-- 1 hosting-user hosting-user 101 Dec 14 22:52 index.html
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 hosting-user hosting-user 318 Dec 14 22:49 pull.php

See `pull.php` above? It's there in the sample repo we're using for this tutorial, but you'll need to make one.
Create a PHP file (we'll call ours `pull.php`) with the following contents:

```
<?php
`git pull`;                         // This will execute the `git pull` command on your instance
header("Cache-Control: max-age=1"); // Lower the cache while we're here so the changes take effect faster
echo "hello!";                      // So you can confirm the file is in the right place by browsing to the URL
?>
```

Make sure the file is executable:

    $ chmod +x pull.php

Check that everything is working correctly by browsing to the URL corresponding to `pull.php`. In our case, it looks like this:

    http://squirrels.gandi.xyz/pull.php

Next, go to the settings page of your GitHub repo, then choose "Webhooks & Services" from the menu on the left.

Click "Add webhook" and paste the path to your .php file in the "Payload URL" field:

![screenshot](http://ss.squirrel.li/image/1U1G3l133O3O)

It may take a few minutes to start working due to the Varnish cache. Thereafter, note that changes will still take about a minute to be visible unless you purge the cache manually.

Now, every time your repo is updated, your website will be, too!
